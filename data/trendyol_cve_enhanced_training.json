This vulnerability requires immediate professional attention due to its potential impact on enterprise security.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\nWhoDB is an open source database management tool. While the application only displays Sqlite3 databases present in the directory `/db`, there is no path traversal prevention in place. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to open any Sqlite3 database present on the host machine that the application is running on. Affected versions of WhoDB allow users to connect to Sqlite3 databases. By default, the databases must be present in `/db/` (or alternatively `./tmp/` if development mode is enabled).  If no databases are present in the default directory, the UI indicates that the user is unable to open any databases. The database file is an user-controlled value. This value is used in `.Join()` with the default directory, in order to get the full path of the database file to open. No checks are performed whether the database file that is eventually opened actually resides in the default directory `/db`. This allows an attacker to use path traversal (`../../`) in order to open any Sqlite3 database present on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Severity Level**: CRITICAL\n- **CVSS Score**: 10.0\n- **Attack Vector**: NETWORK\n- **Attack Complexity**: LOW\n- **Security Domain**: Web Application\n\n**Professional Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - Assess enterprise exposure to this vulnerability\n   - Prioritize patching based on CVSS score and business impact\n   - Implement temporary mitigations if patches unavailable\n   - Update threat intelligence feeds with CVE-2025-24786 indicators\n\n2. **Enterprise Security Measures:**\n   - Deploy detection rules for exploitation attempts\n   - Update vulnerability scanning signatures\n   - Review and strengthen related security controls\n   - Conduct threat hunting for indicators of compromise\n\n3. **Incident Response Preparation:**\n   - Update incident response playbooks with CVE-2025-24786 scenarios\n   - Train security teams on vulnerability exploitation techniques\n   - Establish communication protocols for vulnerability incidents\n   - Prepare forensic procedures for potential compromises\n\n**Compliance Considerations:**\nThis vulnerability assessment aligns with SOC2, ISO27001, and NIST cybersecurity frameworks.

The issue lies within the themeeditor controller (file: /applications/core/modules/front/system/themeeditor.php), where a protected method named customCss can be invoked by unauthenticated users. This method passes the value of the content parameter to the Theme::makeProcessFunction() method; hence it is evaluated by the template engine.

This vulnerability requires immediate professional attention due to its potential impact on enterprise security.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\nHikka, a Telegram userbot, has vulnerability affects all users on all versions of Hikka. Two scenarios are possible. 1. Web interface does not have an authenticated session: attacker can use his own Telegram account to gain RCE to the server by authorizing in the dangling web interface. 2. Web interface does have an authenticated session: due to insufficient warning in the authentication message, users were tempted to click \"Allow\" in the \"Allow web application ops\" menu. This gave an attacker access not only to remote code execution, but also to Telegram accounts of owners. Scenario number 2 is known to have been exploited in the wild. No known patches are available, but some workarounds are available. Use `--no-web` flag and do not start userbot without it; after authorizing in the web interface, close the port on the server and/or start the userbot with `--no-web` flag; and do not click \"Allow\" in your helper bot unless it is your explicit action that needs to be allowed.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Severity Level**: CRITICAL\n- **CVSS Score**: 10.0\n- **Attack Vector**: NETWORK\n- **Attack Complexity**: LOW\n- **Security Domain**: Mobile Security\n\n**Professional Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - Assess enterprise exposure to this vulnerability\n   - Prioritize patching based on CVSS score and business impact\n   - Implement temporary mitigations if patches unavailable\n   - Update threat intelligence feeds with CVE-2025-52572 indicators\n\n2. **Enterprise Security Measures:**\n   - Deploy detection rules for exploitation attempts\n   - Update vulnerability scanning signatures\n   - Review and strengthen related security controls\n   - Conduct threat hunting for indicators of compromise\n\n3. **Incident Response Preparation:**\n   - Update incident response playbooks with CVE-2025-52572 scenarios\n   - Train security teams on vulnerability exploitation techniques\n   - Establish communication protocols for vulnerability incidents\n   - Prepare forensic procedures for potential compromises\n\n**Compliance Considerations:**\nThis vulnerability assessment aligns with SOC2, ISO27001, and NIST cybersecurity frameworks.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Severity Level**: CRITICAL\n- **CVSS Score**: 10.0\n- **Attack Vector**: NETWORK\n- **Attack Complexity**: LOW\n- **Security Domain**: Web Application\n\n**Professional Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - Assess enterprise exposure to this vulnerability\n   - Prioritize patching based on CVSS score and business impact\n   - Implement temporary mitigations if patches unavailable\n   - Update threat intelligence feeds with CVE-2025-20309 indicators\n\n2. **Enterprise Security Measures:**\n   - Deploy detection rules for exploitation attempts\n   - Update vulnerability scanning signatures\n   - Review and strengthen related security controls\n   - Conduct threat hunting for indicators of compromise\n\n3. **Incident Response Preparation:**\n   - Update incident response playbooks with CVE-2025-20309 scenarios\n   - Train security teams on vulnerability exploitation techniques\n   - Establish communication protocols for vulnerability incidents\n   - Prepare forensic procedures for potential compromises\n\n**Compliance Considerations:**\nThis vulnerability assessment aligns with SOC2, ISO27001, and NIST cybersecurity frameworks. Regular vulnerability management demonstrates due diligence in enterprise security practices.\n\n**Threat Intelligence Context:**\nCVE-2025-20309 represents a significant threat vector that requires continuous monitoring. Security teams should implement behavioral analytics to detect exploitation patterns and maintain updated threat intelligence feeds.\n\n**Professional Recommendations:**\n- Implement defense-in-depth strategies\n- Regular security assessments and penetration testing\n- Continuous vulnerability monitoring and management\n- Employee security awareness training\n- Incident response capability development",

This vulnerability requires immediate professional attention due to its potential impact on enterprise security.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\nA SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. In version 5.0.1, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).
