Prompt Injection Attack Implementation

This module implements various prompt injection techniques for educational
and defensive testing purposes. Prompt injection is one of the most common
LLM vulnerabilities where malicious instructions are embedded in user input.

Types of prompt injection:
1. Direct injection: Directly overriding system instructions
2. Indirect injection: Using external content to inject malicious prompts
3. Context manipulation: Exploiting conversation history
4. Instruction confusion: Making the model ignore previous instructions
